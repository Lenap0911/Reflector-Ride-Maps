## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** for data processing
- **Tippecanoe** for PMTiles generation:
  ```bash
  brew install tippecanoe  # macOS
  # or see: https://github.com/felt/tippecanoe
  ```

### One-Command Processing

The easiest way to process your data:

```bash
python master_pipeline.py
```

This automated pipeline runs all processing steps:
1. ✅ Converts CSV files to GeoJSON
2. ✅ Calculates speeds from wheel rotation data
3. ✅ Analyzes traffic light behavior
4. ✅ Generates PMTiles for web visualization

## 📋 Detailed Workflow

### Step 1: Convert Raw CSVs to GeoJSON

Place your CSV files in a `csv_data/` folder, then run:

```bash
python csv_to_geojson_converter.py
```

**What it does:**
- Reads CSV files with GPS coordinates and sensor data
- Converts to GeoJSON format with LineString geometries
- Organizes by sensor ID (e.g., `602B3`, `604F0`)
- Extracts metadata from CSV footers
- **Output:** `sensor_data/{sensor_id}/{sensor_id}_Trip{N}_clean.geojson`

**Input CSV format:**
```csv
latitude,longitude,HH:mm:ss,SSS,marker,HRot Count,Samples,Speed
52.3644,4.9130,14:23:45,123,2,100,1000,
52.3645,4.9131,14:23:46,123,3,102,1050,234
...
Bike: Trek 820
Distance: 5.2 km
```

### Step 2: Calculate Speeds from Sensor Data

```bash
python integrated_processor.py
```

**What it does:**
- Reads cleaned GeoJSON files from `sensor_data/`
- Calculates speed using **wheel rotation (HRot)** data:
  - Uses 711mm wheel diameter (configurable)
  - Formula: `speed = (wheel_rotations × circumference) / time`
- Creates line segments only where the wheel actually moved
- Filters out stopped periods and anomalies
- Assesses road quality based on GPS accuracy and movement patterns
- **Output:** `processed_sensor_data/{sensor_id}_Trip{N}_processed.geojson`

**Key calculations:**
- Wheel circumference: ~2.073 meters
- Sample rate: 50 Hz (0.02 seconds per sample)
- Speed cap: 50 km/h (filters unrealistic values)

**Properties added:**
- `Speed`: km/h calculated from wheel rotation
- `road_quality`: 1-5 rating (1=perfect, 5=no road)
- `hrot_diff`: Wheel rotation difference
- `time_diff_s`: Time between points
- `gps_distance_m`: GPS distance for validation

### Step 3: Generate Traffic Light Analysis

```bash
python generate_traffic_light_analysis.py
```

**What it does:**
- Loads traffic light locations from `traffic_lights.json`
- Analyzes all processed trips for behavior near each light (25m radius)
- Detects sudden braking events (entering zone at <5 km/h)
- Measures extended stops (time spent at <2 km/h)
- Calculates three scores per light:
  - **Safety score**: Based on sudden braking frequency
  - **Efficiency score**: Based on time spent stopped
  - **Overall score**: Weighted combination (60% safety, 40% efficiency)
- **Output:** `traffic_lights_analyzed.json`

**Analysis metrics:**
- Detection radius: 25 meters
- Sudden brake threshold: <5 km/h at entry
- Stop threshold: <2 km/h
- Score range: 0-100 (0 = excellent, 100 = critical)

### Step 4: Build PMTiles for Web

```bash
python build_pmtiles.py
```

**What it does:**
- Uses Tippecanoe to compress processed GeoJSON into PMTiles format
- PMTiles = efficient vector tiles for web maps
- Preserves `Speed`, `road_quality`, `marker`, and `trip_id` properties
- **Output:** `trips.pmtiles` (~90% smaller than raw GeoJSON)

**Why PMTiles?**
- Efficient: Dramatically smaller file size
- Fast: Only loads visible tiles
- Standard: Works with MapLibre/Mapbox GL JS

## 🔧 Configuration

### Wheel Settings (in `integrated_processor.py`):

```python
WHEEL_DIAMETER_MM = 711  
WHEEL_CIRCUMFERENCE_M = (711 / 1000) * math.pi  # ~2.234m
```

Adjust these for your specific bike wheel size.

### Traffic Light Settings (in `generate_traffic_light_analysis.py`):

```python
radius = 25              # Detection radius in meters
BRAKE_THRESHOLD = 5.0    # km/h - sudden braking
STOP_THRESHOLD = 2.0     # km/h - stopped/nearly stopped
```

### Map Settings (in `config.js`):

```javascript
MAP_CENTER: [4.9041, 52.3676],  // Amsterdam coordinates
MAP_ZOOM: 13,                    // Initial zoom level
MAP_STYLE: 'https://...'         // CartoDB Dark Matter
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "PMTiles shows all gray/red"
- Check that `Speed` property exists in processed GeoJSON
- Verify wheel diameter matches your bike
- Rebuild: `python build_pmtiles.py`

### "Traffic lights not showing"
- Ensure `traffic_lights.json` exists
- Run: `python generate_traffic_light_analysis.py`
- Check that processed trip data exists

### "Map is blank"
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `trips.pmtiles` exists
- Confirm coordinates are in correct area

### "No trip data found"
- Ensure CSV files are in `csv_data/` folder
- Run complete pipeline: `python master_pipeline.py`
- Check that CSV format matches expected structure
