      <h4>Purpose of the Dashboard</h4>
      <p>
        This dashboard is designed for officials and urban planners within the
        Municipality of Amsterdam to demonstrate the potential of
        <strong>cycling-behaviour-informed policy planning</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It combines self-collected cycling sensor data (speed and braking behaviour)
        with third-party infrastructure data (road quality and traffic lights).
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The dataset is based on approximately <strong>100 recorded cycling trips</strong>
        and should be interpreted as exploratory and illustrative.
      </p>

      <h4>How to Read the Map</h4>
      <p>
        The map visualises Amsterdam’s cycling network using selectable data layers.
        Each layer has its own scale, legend, and policy interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
        White circles indicate locations where no corresponding sensor data is
        available for the selected filter.
      </p>

      <h4>Available Data Layers</h4>

      <h5>Speed</h5>
      <p>
        Displays average cycling speed across recorded trips, supporting the
        identification of slow or fast corridors.
      </p>

      <h5>Road Quality</h5>
      <p>
        Based on third-party infrastructure data, categorised from “Perfect” to
        “No road”, supporting infrastructure assessment and maintenance planning.
      </p>

      <h5>Traffic Light Analysis</h5>
      <p>
        Analyses cyclist behaviour within a 25-metre radius around traffic lights.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Safety – Sudden Braking:</strong> detected when cyclists enter the
          zone at speeds below 5 km/h, indicating potential safety risks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Efficiency – Extended Stops:</strong> measured as the percentage
          of time spent stopped or nearly stopped (below 2 km/h).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Balanced:</strong> combines both indicators.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Averaged Road Segments</h5>
      <p>
        Aggregates speed and road quality into averaged scores per road segment,
        supporting corridor-level analysis.
      </p>

      <h5>Composite Score (Quality + Speed)</h5>
      <p>
        Combines infrastructure condition and cycling performance into a single
        indicator for comparative assessment.
      </p>

      <h4>Using Filters and Interpretations</h4>
      <p>
        Filters can be activated individually or in combination. Each combination
        reflects a deliberate analytical perspective chosen by the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dashboard does not prescribe a single interpretation, but supports
        exploratory, policy-driven analysis.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>Responsible Use</h4>
      <p>
        Behavioural indicators should be understood as signals rather than
        definitive diagnoses. Results should be interpreted alongside contextual
        knowledge of street design, traffic conditions, and policy objectives.
